#  Backend for a CRM System

<p>
A Customer relationship management (CRM) is a technology for managing all your company’s relationships and interactions with customers and potential customers. The goal is simple: Improve business relationships. A CRM system helps companies stay connected to customers, streamline processes, and improve profitability.
</P>


## Business Logic:

1. The CRM account is associated with each employee/student-counsellor of the company with
their email id & password.

2. There is an enquiry form which is provided to every prospective client to fill their basic details
i.e. Name, Email, Course interest etc. This form can be circulated online to capture leads or
can be shared by the counsellor itself after it has connected with the student via call.

3. Inside the CRM, each employee/counsellor can see all the enquiries that prospective clients
have filled. We can say these are Public Enquiries that are visible to all the
employee/counsellor.

4. Against each public enquiry, the employee/counsellor has a choice to “Claim” it. Claiming it
will assign the enquiry to only this counsellor inside the CRM & this enquiry will no longer be
publically visible to any other employee. We can say that this is now a private enquiry.

<!-- 5. Django Admin Panel for CRUD operations of all the relevant fields, implemented
above -->

### Constraint:

- Database must be PostgreSQL/MySQL.

- The backend must be designed in DjangoRestFramework.

## Steps for Setting Up Development Environment:

1. First create a blank database as per requirements.
2. Create the ```.env``` file as per format given below.
3. Fill values of ```.env``` file as per constraints of system.
4. Run: ``` python -m venv env``` to create a _virtual environment_.
5. Run: ``` source env/scripts or bin/activate ``` to activate _virtual environment_.
    - ```scripts``` for __Windows__.
    - ```bin``` for ___Linux___/__Mac__/__Unix__.
6. Run ```python -m pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install all dependencies within the _virtual environment_.
    - Debug and install the dependencies manually via ```pip``` if the ```cannot configure/install wheel``` error pops up.
7. Run: ``` python manage.py makemigrations ```
8. Run: ``` python manage.py migrate ```
9. Run: ``` python manage.py createsuperuser```
    
    - Add __superuser__ credentials as required.
10. Run: ``` python manage.py runserver```
11. Go to: ```localhost:8000/admin``` and create an Agent instance using the __superuser__.

### .env File Format:

```
SECRET_KEY = ' '
DATABASE = ' '
HOST = ' '
PORT =  
USER = ' '
PASSWORD = ' '
```
